Fractals using quantum state vectors. Inspired and in collaboration with Wiktor Mazin.


insert the quantum state vectors into the file "statevectors.txt". Each newline is another quantum statevector.
note* make sure there is no newlines at the end of the document

to start, type "node fractal_main.js"
the fractals will be generated in the browser. The larger the statevectors, the longer it takes.
adjust the "iterations" and "size" parameters in the fractals.html to increase performance or quality.
